Medication reminder App is an app to help young souls remind their everlasting seniors to take their medication.

The app as a React Frontend, Python (Flask) Backend, Twilio as a text messenger and Auth0 for user authentication.

Once you power the react app with  `npm start`  and  you run `python app.py` everything afterwards is seemlessly straightforward.
